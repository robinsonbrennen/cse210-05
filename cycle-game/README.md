# Cycle
Cycle is a game where each player has to cut your opponent, but be careful, or you might end up cutting yourself! Each player will leave a trail that will increase as they eat. The more you eat, the more opportunities you will have to cut your opponent. The game ends if you touch your opponent's trail or your own.

Players can move up, down, left and right...
-- Player one moves using the W, S, A and D keys.
-- Player two moves using the I, K, J and L keys.

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

python3 snake 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.
